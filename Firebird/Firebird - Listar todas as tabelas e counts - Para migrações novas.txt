/* first update the statistics */
UPDATE RDB$INDICES SET RDB$STATISTICS = -1;
COMMIT;

/* Display table names and record counts */
SELECT RDB$RELATIONS.RDB$RELATION_NAME,
CASE 
WHEN RDB$INDICES.RDB$STATISTICS = 0 THEN 0 
ELSE CAST(1 / RDB$INDICES.RDB$STATISTICS AS INTEGER) 
END 
FROM RDB$RELATIONS 
LEFT JOIN RDB$RELATION_CONSTRAINTS 
 ON RDB$RELATIONS.RDB$RELATION_NAME = RDB$RELATION_CONSTRAINTS.RDB$RELATION_NAME 
 AND RDB$CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'PRIMARY KEY'
LEFT JOIN RDB$INDICES 
  ON RDB$RELATION_CONSTRAINTS.RDB$INDEX_NAME = RDB$INDICES.RDB$INDEX_NAME 
WHERE RDB$VIEW_BLR IS NULL AND RDB$RELATION_ID >= 128 
ORDER BY 1;



OBS:
This solution only returns an approximate record count. As Ann W. Harrison kindly explains: Any record that has had its primary key modified will appear twice if the old version has not been garbage collected and deleted records will continue in the count until they are garbage collected.

This will only work on tables that have a primary key.
